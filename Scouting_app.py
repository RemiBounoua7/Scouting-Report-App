Disclaimer : This model and graphs do not take defense into account. 
A player can shoot 70% at the rim for the season and put up mediocre attemps against a well organised PlayOff defense, his xPTS will still account for the RS numbers.
You have to take this into account when using these numbers to evaluate performances. Stats don't tell the full story, always back up your claims with film. The link to game footage is to be found below game shotchart graph.
